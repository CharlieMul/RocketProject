# RocketProject
    A rocket algorithm project that attempts to imitate better algorithm projects.

# Specifics:
    The rockets and obstacles can be chosen by the user with a maximum and minimum.
    The rockets will automatically home in on a central objective upon having a clear line of sight.
    Upon hitting an object or the screen edges, the rockets will reverse their velocity and bounce. 
    Upon hitting the objective, the rocket will stop moving.
